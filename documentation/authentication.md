# Authentication Summary

## Key Points

- Every backend endpoint is protected except `POST /auth/token`.
- Without a Bearer token: `403`; invalid or expired token: `401`.
- The frontend only sends or clears the token; security remains in the backend.
- Every protected call must use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
- Every public exception must be documented and tested.

This document describes the functional constraints to follow for any change that
touches authentication, backend routes, or frontend API calls.

## Objective

The application uses simple Bearer authentication to protect collection data.
The backend remains the single authority for validating tokens and deciding
whether a request is authorized.

The frontend must never contain business security logic. It may hide actions or
avoid unnecessary calls, but all real protection must remain on the backend side.

## Backend Contract

- All application backend endpoints must require a valid Bearer token.
- The only public application route is `POST /auth/token`, used to obtain a
  token.
- CORS `OPTIONS` requests remain exempt to allow preflights.
- Routes must be protected globally with `AuthGuard.protect_all_routes`.
- Do not add a new public route without an explicit decision and without
  documenting the exception in this file.
- Do not duplicate authentication logic in business services.
- Do not read or validate the token directly in endpoints, except for a very
  local and justified need.

## Obtaining a Token

Endpoint:

```http
POST /auth/token
Content-Type: application/json
```

Accepted JSON body:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password"
}
```

The backend also accepts the `client_id` and `client_secret` fields for a flow
compatible with client credentials.

Expected response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

Invalid credentials return `401` with a
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="CloudCollectionApp"`.

## Protected Calls

All calls to protected endpoints must send:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Response codes to preserve:

- `403` if no Bearer token is provided.
- `401` if a token is provided but is invalid or expired.
- `200`, `201`, `400`, `404`, or `500` according to the route's business
  contract once the token has been validated.

The current message for a missing token is `Token Bearer manquant.`.

## Token Format and Validation

- Tokens are created by `AuthTokenService`.
- The internal format is `payload.signature`.
- The payload contains at least `sub`, `iat`, and `exp`.
- The signature uses HMAC SHA-256 with the application secret.
- The default lifetime is 3600 seconds.
- Validation must check the structure, signature, and expiration.
- Never accept an unsigned token or a token whose expiration has passed.

## Environment Variables

Main variables:

- `AUTH_USERNAME`: authorized username.
- `AUTH_PASSWORD_ENCRYPTED`: encrypted application password.
- `AUTH_SECRET_KEY_ENCRYPTED`: encrypted signing secret.
- `AUTH_ENV_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Fernet key used to decrypt secrets.
- `AUTH_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS`: Bearer token lifetime.

The plaintext variables `AUTH_PASSWORD` and `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` exist as
development fallbacks, but no hardcoded secret must be introduced in code,
tests, documentation, or scripts.

## Frontend Contract

- The token is stored in `localStorage` under `cloudCollectionAccessToken`.
- Local expiration is stored under `cloudCollectionAccessTokenExpiresAt`.
- All protected backend calls must go through `JeuxVideoApi` or reuse
  `JeuxVideoApi.getAuthorizationHeaders()`.
- The frontend must avoid calling protected endpoints when no token is stored.
- The public unauthenticated page is `AboutView` on `/about`.
- The authenticated home page is `HomeView` on `/accueil`.
- The `/` route functionally redirects to `/about` without a token and to
  `/accueil` with a token.
- If a sent token is rejected (`401` or `403`), the frontend must clear the local
  session and open the sign-in flow again.

## Route Discovery

`GET /api/routes` is itself protected. It helps the frontend calculate action
permissions, but it must not become a source of truth for security. Security
remains enforced by the backend before each request.

The routes returned by this catalog must correctly indicate:

- `requires_auth`
- `access`
- `auth_schemes`

Every protected route must announce `requires_auth: true` and `auth_schemes:
["Bearer"]`.

## Tests to Maintain

Any authentication change must update or add backend tests covering at least:

- `POST /auth/token` with valid credentials.
- `POST /auth/token` with invalid credentials.
- A protected endpoint without a token returning `403`.
- A protected endpoint with an invalid token returning `401`.
- A protected endpoint with a valid token preserving its business behavior.
- The `/api/routes` catalog and its authentication indicators.

After modification, run:

```bash
./test_backend.sh
```

If the change impacts runtime behavior, rebuild the affected Docker images when
the Docker daemon is available.

## Development Rules

- Never expose collection data from the backend without a token.
- Never reintroduce a public read mode that only hides some fields on the backend
  side.
- Never hardcode a secret, token, password, or signing key.
- Do not add an external authentication dependency without strong justification.
- Prefer extending `AuthGuard` and `AuthTokenService` over scattered checks.
- Every public exception must be explicit, tested, and mentioned in this
  document.
